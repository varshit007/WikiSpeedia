# Weekly Development
Starting the week of 11/16, we will update this document every Friday with one paragraph describing what was accomplished during the week.

# 11/20
This week, we completed the team goals and all signed the team project, which means we agreed on a data set and the algorithms that we will implement for the final project. We plan on meeting at some point next week to discuss details for the next steps to take.

# 11/27
This week, we completed the boilerplate for the code base. (All necessary files are in place and both main and the tests are compiling and running correctly). The next step will be to meet to discuss who will handle which of the remaining 4 things to do. (Parsing and 3 algorithm methods).

# 12/4
We finalized our individual responsibilities this week and discussed more specifically what the API for each algorithm will look like since there are dependencies across our assignments (e.g. all the algorithms rely on the data parsing). We also met with our TA to make sure we were on track and all on the same page. The landmark algorithm has been implemented and the others are in progress. We planned our next meeting as well as how we will support each other in case of roadblocks.

# 12/11
In the final week of our project we completed the implementation of all our algorithms and operations: parsing the dataset into a graph structure (this also entailed switching which file we used in the dataset), djikstra's shortest path, breadth-first search traversal, and the landmark path. We met early in the week to make sure everyone was on track and provided feedback on each other's work to make everything as efficient as possible. Once the base algorithms were completed, we developed a simple executable showcasing examples of the functions. We added more test cases for both generic and dataset-specific cases to make sure it was working as expected. We finished writing the report and created the final video together.
